        <h2>Discrete math</h2>
        <p>
            Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" (in a way analogous
            to discrete variables, having a bijection with the set of natural numbers) rather than "continuous" (analogously to
            continuous functions). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, graphs, and statements in logic.
            By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as real numbers, calculus or Euclidean geometry.
            Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers; more formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the
            branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers).
            However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics".

            The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes
            applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant
            to business.

            Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development
            of digital computers which operate in "discrete" steps and store data in "discrete" bits. Concepts and notations
            from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science,
            such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development.
            Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world
            problems.

        <h2>Differential equations</h2>
        <p>
            In mathematics, a differential equation is an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives.
            In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change,
            and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Such relations are common; therefore,
            differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology.

            Mainly the study of differential equations consists of the study of their solutions (the set of functions that satisfy each equation),
            and of the properties of their solutions. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas;
            however, many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without computing
            them exactly.

        <h2>System Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            A system architecture is the conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and more views of a system.
            An architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system, organized in a way that
            supports reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system.

            A system architecture can consist of system components and the sub-systems developed, that will work together
            to implement the overall system. There have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system
            architecture, collectively these are called architecture description languages (ADLs).
